# mb-book-search

## Description

Using this application, you'll be able to search for books! After creating an account and then searching for a specific book using googles API, which basically means every book EVER,
you will be prompted to then add the book to your collection. After adding the book, you can then delete it once you feel satisfied with said book. This project will make it much easier
to find specific books that you're wanting to read. You'll never forget a book, as you'll be able to come back and look at your collection at all times, as long as you have a connection.
